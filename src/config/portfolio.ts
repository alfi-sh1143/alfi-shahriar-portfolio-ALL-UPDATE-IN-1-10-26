    summary: "Exploring decentralized AI/ML paradigms to safeguard interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) nodes without centralizing raw network telemetry.",
    concept: "IoT and edge devices generate network and security telemetry locally. Traditional intrusion detection relies on transferring vast volumes of raw data to a central cloud, exposing user privacy and causing massive bandwidth bottlenecks. Federated Learning allows participating edge clients to train local anomaly detection models on-device and communicate only encrypted model weight gradients to a central coordinator. The server aggregates these updates (via FedAvg or robust aggregators) to iteratively refine a global defense model without ever collecting raw network packets.",
